Immersive Railroading can be customized in a number of ways, via the config or external means:

# Config
IR has a large number of config options, the following are just some highlights.
* Acceptable fluids for Diesel Locomotive fuel
* Village payout items and the fare they pay (X blocks = 1 payout item)
* Modifiers of physical parameters of trains, including braking distancing, ease/difficulty of slopes, diesel warmup time, and steam water usage to name a few
* Cost modifiers for placing track

You can open up the in-game config screen via the "/" key on the numpad by default for client side settings. For server, go to config[TODO].
