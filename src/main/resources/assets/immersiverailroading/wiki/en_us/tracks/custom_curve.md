# Overview
This mode is used to place customizable curve track.

By the way, you can use the [Golden Spike](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/tracks/golden_spike.md) to make more remarkable effects.

# Settings
### Length
This setting determines how many blocks long the piece of track is.

### Vertical Smoothing
If the curve has a slope(via the [Golden Spike](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/tracks/golden_spike.md)), this option determines whether the track will be vertically smoothed at both ends to join the other tracks.

Current options are:
* Both

### Curvosity
This setting controls the horizontal curvosity of the turning section if it is customized by the [Golden Spike](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/tracks/golden_spike.md), higher value means more curved.
