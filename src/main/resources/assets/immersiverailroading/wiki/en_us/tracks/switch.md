# Overview
This mode is used to create track switch, and you can control the target direction by giving redstone signal to the turning block.

By the way, you can use the [Golden Spike](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/tracks/golden_spike.md) to make more remarkable effects.

# Settings
### Length
This setting determines the radius of the turning section. 

### Direction
This setting controls whether the direction of switch is forced to be left/right or based on the direction the player is looking.

### Turn Degrees
This setting determines how large the angle of the turning section should be.

### Vertical Smoothing
If the switch's turning section has a slope(via the [Golden Spike](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/tracks/golden_spike.md)), this option determines whether the track will be smoothed vertically at both ends to join the other tracks.

Current options are:
* Both

* Near(lower end)

* Far(upper end)

* Neither

### Curvosity
This setting controls the horizontal curvosity of the turning section if it is customized by the [Golden Spike](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/tracks/golden_spike.md), higher value means more curved.

# Example
A switch set to the straight direction:

And it can be set to the turn direction by giving a redstone signal:
