# Overview
This mode is used to create track switch, and you can control the target direction by giving redstone signal to the turning block.

# Settings
### Length
This setting determines the radius of the turning section. 

The straight section will have a constant length of 31m at standard gauge (1.435m) and will be scaled proportionally to the actual gauge.

### Direction
This setting controls whether the direction of switch is forced to be left/right or based on the direction the player is looking.

### Turn Degrees
This setting determines how large the angle of the turning section should be.

### Vertical Smoothing
If the switch has a slope, this option determines whether the track will be smoothed vertically at both ends to join the other tracks.

Current options are:
* Both
