Augments are tools which can be placed on the track to act as the bridge between stocks and the world.  
To take advantage from them, right-click on a track segment to apply the augment. 
And to remove it, right\-click the track it attached to with the wrench.
By right-clicking on the augment with a name tag, it can be set to only detect/control/interact stocks with the exact same name, and ignore other stocks.

//TODO Need more detailed example
