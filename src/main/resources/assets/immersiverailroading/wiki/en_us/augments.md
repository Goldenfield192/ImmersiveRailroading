# Overview
Augments are bridges between stock and environment, with the function of detect, control, load, or unload and so on.
Note that although there's an augment named water through, it has no function.

# Usage
Augments can be placed on the track to act as the bridge between stocks and the world.  
To take advantage from them, right-click on a track segment to apply the augment. 
And to remove it, right-click the track it attached to with the wrench.
By right-clicking on the augment with a name tag or a stock item, it can be set to only detect/control/interact stocks with the exact same name/type, and ignore all other stocks.
