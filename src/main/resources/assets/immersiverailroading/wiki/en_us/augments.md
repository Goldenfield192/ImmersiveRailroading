Augments are tools which can be placed on the track to act as the bridge between stocks and the world.  
To take advantage from them, right-click on a track segment to apply the augment. 
And to remove it, right-click the track it attached to with the wrench.
By right-clicking on the augment with a name tag or a stock item, it can be set to only detect/control/interact stocks with the exact same name/type, and ignore other stocks.

//TODO Need more detailed example

Note that although there's an augment named water through, it has no function.
