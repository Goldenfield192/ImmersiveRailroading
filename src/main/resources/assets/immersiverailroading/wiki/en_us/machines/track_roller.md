# Usage
The Track Roller requires power to operate, which can be input through the orange-yellow colored block on the top of the machine via any RF/IF-compatible method of power transfer. 

To create track sections, make a Rail Casting in the [Casting Basin](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/casting_basin.md) and, with the casting in hand, right-click the Track Roller. After the animation completes, right-click the multiblock to receive 10 track segments in a given gauge.

These Track Segments are used with the [Track Blueprint](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/track_blueprint.md) to lay down sections of track.
