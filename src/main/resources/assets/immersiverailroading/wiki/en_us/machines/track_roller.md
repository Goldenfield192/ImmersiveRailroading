# Overview
The Track Roller is used to create track pieces for use with Track Blueprints.

# Construction
The Track Roller requires a clear, level space that is 30 blocks deep, 2 blocks wide, and 3 blocks tall. When placed, the short side will be facing the player, and offset 1 block to the right. After placing, right-click with a Large Wrench anywhere on the arrangement of blocks to assemble the machine.

It is built from:
* Steel Scaffolding × 44
* Heavy Engineering Block × 16
* Light Engineering Block × 32
If Immersive Engineering is not installed, the Track Roller will be built from:
* Iron Bars × 44
* Iron Block × 48

# Usage
The Track Roller requires power to operate, which can be input at the top of the multiblock via any RF/IF-compatible method of power transfer. To create track sections, make a Rail Casting in the [Casting Basin](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/casting_basin.md) and, with the casting in hand, right-click the Track Roller. After the animation completes, right-click the multiblock to receive 10 track segments in a given gauge.

These Track Segments are used with the [Track Blueprint](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/track_blueprint.md) to lay down sections of track.
