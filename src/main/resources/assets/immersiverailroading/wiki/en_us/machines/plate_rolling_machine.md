# Overview
The Plate Rolling Machine creates Steel Plates and Boiler Plates from Steel Blocks, which are used in the crafting of Locomotives.

# Construction
The Plate Rolling Machine is 30 blocks long, 5 blocks high and 5 blocks wide.
It is built from:
* Heavy Engineering Block × 41
* Steel Scaffolding × 90
* Light Engineering Block × 88
If Immersive Engineering is not installed, the Casting Basin will be built from:
* Iron Block × 129
* Steel Scaffolding × 90

# Usage
The Plate Rolling Machine requires power to operate, which can be input through the orange-yellow colored block on the top of the multiblock via any RF/IF-compatible method of power transfer.

Steel Blocks are input by right-clicking the machine with the blocks in hand, and Steel Blocks can be placed while a plate is being made, which makes the process a bit more efficient.

By right-clicking on the machine, you can open a GUI like this:

The upper button(gauge selector) determines the gauge of the resulting plates, while the lower button(plate type selector) changes between different types of plate each locomotive recipe requires, with the Boiler Plate being used in the creation of steam-powered engines after processing in the [Boiler Roller](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/boiler_roller.md).
