# Overview
The Casting Basin creates different parts for rolling stock, specifically wheels and frames, as well as the Rail Cast for use with the [Track Roller](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/track_roller.md). The Gauge selector changes between gauges.

# Construction
The Casting Basin is 23 blocks long, 8 blocks high and 7 blocks wide.
It is built from:
* Stone Bricks × 114
* Heavy Engineering Block × 15
* Sand × 126
* Blast Brick × 86
* Steel Scaffolding × 63
* Block of Steel × 1
If Immersive Engineering is not installed, the Casting Basin will be built from:
* Stone Bricks × 114
* Iron Block × 165
* Sand × 126
* Blast Brick × 86
* Steel Scaffolding × 63

# Usage
The Casting Basin requires power to operate, which can be input through the orange-yellow colored block on the top of the machine via any RF/IF-compatible method of power transfer.

By right-clicking on the machine, you can open a GUI like this:

The type button determines which part will be cast, and the gauge selector button determines the gauge of the resulting plates. The 2 buttons below the gauge selector determine whether the casting is looped or not.

To create a selected part, drop Steel Blocks or Steel Ingots into the Basin and make sure it has power. The part will be created in short order, and you can right-click on the Basin to retrieve the part.

Parts made in the casting basin can be recycled by dropping them back into the basin.
