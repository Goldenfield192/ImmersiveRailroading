# Overview
The Basin creates different parts for rolling stock, specifically wheels and frames, as well as the Rail Cast for use with the [Track Roller](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/track_roller.md). The Gauge selector changes between gauges.

# Construction
It is built from:
* Stone Bricks × 114
* Heavy Engineering Block × 15
* Sand × 126
* Blast Brick × 86
* Steel Scaffolding × 63
