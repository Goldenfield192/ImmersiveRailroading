# Overview
The Steam Hammer is used to process some parts before they are placed onto a Frame. It is the smallest machine in Immersive Railroading, requiring a mere 5 blocks in width, 1 in depth, and 6 in height.

# Construction
It is built from:
* Heavy Engineering Block × 3
* Block of Steel × 1
* Piston × 1
* Light Engineering Block × 10
If Immersive Engineering is not installed, the Steam Hammer will be built from:
* Piston × 1
* Iron Block × 14

# Usage
Operating the Steam Hammer requires power, which is input through the top block. To operate the hammer, right-click the central block to open the GUI. Place the item that should be processed in the left slot, and after a few moments it will move to the right slot, which means it is now ready for use.
