# Overview
The Steam Hammer is used to process some parts before they are placed onto a Frame. It is the smallest machine in Immersive Railroading, requiring a mere 5 blocks wide, 1 in depth, and 6 high.

# Construction
The Steam Hammer is 1 blocks long, 6 blocks high and 5 blocks wide.
It is built from:
* Heavy Engineering Block × 3
* Block of Steel × 1
* Piston × 1
* Light Engineering Block × 10
If Immersive Engineering is not installed, the Steam Hammer will be built from:
* Piston × 1
* Iron Block × 14

# Usage
The Steam Hammer requires power to operate, which can be input through the top of the multiblock via any RF/IF-compatible method of power transfer.

To operate the hammer, right-click the central block to open the GUI. Place the item that should be processed in the left slot, and after a few moments it will move to the right slot, which means it is now ready for use.
