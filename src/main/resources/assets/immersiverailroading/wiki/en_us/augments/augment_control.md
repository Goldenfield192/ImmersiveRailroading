The Locomotive Control Augment is displayed as black block under rail and is used to control the locomotive overhead.

Right-click on the augment with a redstone torch/redstone dust/piston in your hand will switch it between a few modes:
* Throttle: Sets the throttle size proportional to the redstone signal level.
* Reverser: Sets locomotive's reverser to reverse for redstone signal levels below 7, to neutral at 7, and to forward above 7.
* Brake: Sets the train brake proportional to the redstone signal level.
* Horn: Fires off the whistle or horn for 2 seconds if redstone signal present, and if present sets it volume proportional to the redstone signal level.
* Bell: Fires off the bell, and for each level of redstone signal, the ring duration increases by 0.5 seconds.
* Computer: Not available currently.
