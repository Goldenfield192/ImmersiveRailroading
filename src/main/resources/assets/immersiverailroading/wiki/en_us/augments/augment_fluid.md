The Fluid Loader Augment is displayed as blue block under rail and is used to interface with the tank of the locomotive/stock overhead.

Fluid loader will accept fluid from any pipe, like IE, and store it in a small internal tank then dumps into the stock overhead.

The Fluid Unloader Augment is displayed as light blue block under rail and is used to interface with the tank of the locomotive/stock overhead.

Correspondingly, fluid unloader outputs fluid from the stock to any adjacent pipe or tank nearby.
