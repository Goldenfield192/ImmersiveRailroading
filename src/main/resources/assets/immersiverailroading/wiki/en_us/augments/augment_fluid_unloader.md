# Overview
![](immersiverailroading:wiki/images/augments/fluid_unloader.png)
The Fluid Unloader Augment is displayed as light blue block under rail and is used to interface with the tank of the locomotive/stock overhead.

# Usage
The Fluid Unloader Augment outputs fluid from the stock overhead to any adjacent pipe or tank nearby.

By right-clicking with a piston in your hand, you can change pushpull status of this augment. This augment will only work if pushpull is enabled.

Besides, this augment also has 4 redstone modes that can be toggled by holding a redstone torch/redstone dust and right-clicking.
* Enabled: The augment is enabled, regardless of redstone signal.
* Required: The augment is enabled if redstone signal is greater than 0, otherwise it is disabled.
* Inverted: The augment is enabled if redstone signal equals to 0, otherwise it is disabled.
* Disabled: The augment is disabled, regardless of redstone signal.
