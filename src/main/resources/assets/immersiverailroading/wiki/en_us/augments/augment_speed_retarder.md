# Overview
![](immersiverailroading:wiki/images/augments/speed_retarder.png)
The Speed Retarder Augment is displayed as gray block under rail and is used to slow down locomotives/stock which are passing overhead.

# Usage
The Speed Retarder Augment can provide friction force which is proportional to the number of augments under the locomotive/stock and the redstone signal level given.

The more Speed Retarder Augment under the locomotives/stock or the stronger the redstone signal, the more friction there is.
