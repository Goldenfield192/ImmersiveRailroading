# Overview
Steam locomotives require fuel, water and specific controls to operate. You need provide water to turn into steam, and any valid furnace fuel to produce heat.

# Control
Before driving the locomotive, you need to water it. While riding it, right-click and a window pops up:

Put your fluid container with water in the top-left slot, and you'll see the tank fill up. You can also load the water using a [Fluid Loader](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/augments/augment_fluid_loader.md).

Then, you need to add burnable fuel to the firebox slots below the tank. The number of firebox slots varies from locomotive to locomotive. 

Once the fuel is placed in a slot, it will start burning, causing the temperature to rise (The right-most gauge in the bottom left panel). The more slots the fuel occupies, the more rapidly it heats up. And once the temperature is over 100Â°C, the loco will start consuming water to produce steam.

> Do not open the throttle until there's sufficient pressure (the center gauge in the bottom left panel)

By default, most of IR's control keys are on the numpad:

If you don't want to control them via keyboard, there are some alternative ways:
* You can press T to free your cursor and drag the components on the left and right bottom of the screen, or...
* Some locomotives have draggable parts(like br01), and you can drag them to control the loco.

# Tips
* To avoid wheel-slip, gradually increase the throttle and let the loco accelerate.
* To regulate speeds, use a combination of brake and throttle so that the loco doesn't accelerate or decelerate. When driving a fast or heavy train, you won't be able to stop very quickly. Plan ahead for stops and start slowing down well in advance.
* Keep an eye on the water gauge, as the loco has a chance of exploding if it dips below 75%
* You can couple 1 or more tenders behind your loco to add extra storage for fuel and water. The loco will pull from the tender(s) automatically.
