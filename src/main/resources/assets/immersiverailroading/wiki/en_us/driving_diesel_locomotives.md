# Overview
Diesel locomotives require fuel and specific controls to operate.

# Control
Before driving the locomotive, you need to fuel it. while riding it, right-click and a window pops up:

Put your fuel container in the left slot and you'll see the tank fills up. You can also load the fuel using a [Fluid Loader](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/augments/augment_fluid_loader.md).

If you have [Immersive Engineering](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering) installed, you can use Ethanol or BioDiesel; If you have Immersive Petroleum installed as well, diesel fuel works too. Furthermore, most mods that add fluid containers for "kerosene", "gasoline", or "oil" will work too.

If you don't have any of these mods installed, you can add minecraft lava as a fuel.[Config](OBJECT PROMISE)

Once it's running, the temperature will start rising, the throttle will be limited until it's warm, but trying to increase throttle will help it warm-up faster. Once the temperature is over 76Â°C, the loco should be able to start moving. Use the "Brakes Neutral" control to unlock the brakes.

Then, you need to turn it on using the On/Off control.

By default, most of IR's control keys are on the numpad:

If you don't want to control them via keyboard, there are some alternative ways:
* You can press T to free your cursor and drag the components on the left and right bottom of the screen, or...
* Some locomotives have draggable parts(like GE B40-8w), and you can drag them to control the loco.

# Tips
* To avoid wheel-slip, gradually increase the throttle and let the loco accelerate.
* To regulate speeds, use a combination of brake and throttle so that the loco doesn't accelerate or decelerate. When driving a fast or heavy train, you won't be able to stop very quickly. Plan ahead for stops and start slowing down well in advance.
* The longer the throttle is at a high level, the faster the temperature will rise. If the temperature bar goes red, then the loco will shut down until it cools-off to normal temperature.
