The book you are reading, one of the core tools in Immersive Railroading. 

The Blueprint Book contains the blueprints for the machine present in the mod, and is the tool used to place them.

While holding the book with your hand, press shift and right-click in air to toggle between the different machines. Currently, there are five types of machine in the game: [Casting Basin](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/casting_basin.md), [Track Roller](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/track_roller.md), [Steam Hammer](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/steam_hammer.md), [Boiler Roller](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/boiler_roller.md) and [Plate Rolling Machine](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/plate_rolling_machine.md).

To place these machines, right-click on the ground with the book in hand. The book will display if you are missing the blocks required, and will also alert you to the coordinates of any blocks which must be removed to place the chosen machine.
