The Blueprint Book is one of the core tool in Immersive Railroading, containing the blueprints for machines used in the mod. It serves as the primary tool for placing these machines in the game.

It can be made from 1 book and 6 steel ingots:

If Immersive Engineering is not installed, use iron ingots instead of steel ingots.

# Usage
While holding the book with your hand, press shift \+ right-click in air to toggle between the different machines. To place these machines, right-click on the ground with the book in hand.

In Immersive Railroading 1.10, there are 5 machines available:
* [Casting Basin](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/casting_basin.md)
* [Track Roller](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/track_roller.md)
* [Steam Hammer](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/steam_hammer.md)
* [Boiler Roller](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/boiler_roller.md)
* [Plate Rolling Machine](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/machines/plate_rolling_machine.md)

The book will display if you are missing the blocks required, and will also alert you to the coordinates of any blocks which must be removed to place the chosen machine.
