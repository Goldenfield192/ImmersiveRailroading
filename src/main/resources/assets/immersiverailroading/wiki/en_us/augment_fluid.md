The Fluid Loader/Unloader Augments are used to interface with the tank of the locomotive/stock overhead.

The fluid loader will accept fluid from any pipe, like IE, and store it in a small internal tank then dumps into the stock overhead.

Correspondingly, the fluid unloader outputs fluid from the stock to any adjacent pipe or tank nearby.
